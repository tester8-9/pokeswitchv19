## Mods

### Overworld Shiny Indicatiors ``[overworld_shiny]``

Mod that makes shiny pokemon visible in the overworld with a sound indicator & particle effect

#### Example
<!-- TODO: new video with particle effects -->
https://github.com/Lincoln-LM/swsh-mods-exl/assets/73306575/f2a553aa-2f44-40c4-bf16-9b0dd924e1bf

#### Config
- ``active``
    - Controls whether or not the mod is activated
    - boolean (``true``, ``false``)
- ``sound``
    - Controls the "command" that is run upon shiny spawns
    - Leave empty (``""``) for no command
    - Sound effects are commands and that is the intended use of this setting
    - string (``""``, ``"Play_Camp_Cooking_Explosion"``, etc.)
- ``shiny_ptcl``
    - Controls the particle effect that is played around a shiny
    - Leave empty (``""``) for no particle
    - Any .ptcl in romfs or custom layeredfs should work but needs to be configured to repeat
    - string (``""``, ``"bin/field/effect/particle/particle/ef_poke_symbol_aura.ptcl"``, etc.)
- ``show_aura_for_brilliants``
    - Controls whether or not regular brilliant spawns show their aura
    - boolean (``true``, ``false``)
- ``include_battle_sounds``
    - Controls whether or not to load the battle sound bank in the overworld (needed for battle shiny sound)
    - boolean (``true``, ``false``)
- ``play_sound_for_following``
    - Controls whether or not to play the shiny sound when the following pokemon respawns
    - boolean (``true``, ``false``)
- ``show_ptcl_for_following``
    - Controls whether or not to show the shiny particle for the following pokemon
    - boolean (``true``, ``false``)
- ``show_message_box``
    - Controls whether or not to show a message box on screen when a shiny spawns
    - **Note:** When loading a save or returning from a battle with a shiny pokemon spawned [the message box may not be visible and the game will look like it is infinitely loading](https://github.com/Lincoln-LM/swsh-mods-exl/issues/17#issuecomment-2600940563) but the message box can be cleared as normal
    - boolean (``true``, ``false``)
- ``boosted_percentage``
    - Controls the percentage for the modified overworld shiny odds
    - Set to 0 for regular shiny odds
    - This setting is intended to be used to ensure shiny models are functioning properly, not as a standalone shiny odds boost cheat
    - integer [0, 100]

#### Notes
- Hooks the check that determines whether or not a PokemonModel should display shininess to always return true (normally only true for following pokemon)
    - If the PokemonModel is shiny -> call SendCommand to trigger the sound effect
- Hooks the functions responsible for adding & playing the particle effects to supply a custom .ptcl path
- Hooks the brilliant aura check (only for displaying the effect) for both EncountObjects and FishingPoints to check the shiny flag or the brilliant flag
    - FishingPoints do not use PokemonModels so the sound effect for them is triggered here
- Hooks the instruction that sets the shiny flag to call an external PRNG to determine shininess based on percentage (``randU64() % 100 < boosted_rate``)

### Underworld ``[underworld]``

Mod that makes [symbol encounters](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Symbol_encounter) pull from the encounter tables of [hidden encounters](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hidden_encounter), allowing "underworld"-exclusive pokemon to spawn and be visible in the overworld

This is a reimplementation of [norainthefuture](https://twitter.com/norainthefuture)'s mod which accomplishes the swapping via exefs patching rather than manually swapping the data tables. The idea is entirely by her!

#### Example
https://github.com/Lincoln-LM/swsh-mods-exl/assets/73306575/06888db2-8cd5-409a-931d-5fa9fb14f62e

#### Config
- ``active``
    - Controls whether or not the mod is activated
    - boolean (``true``, ``false``)
<!-- TODO -->
<!-- - ``disable_brilliants``
    - Controls whether or not brilliant spawns are possible for hidden encounters
    - This option exists to preserve legality of the pokemon generated with this mod active as hidden encounters cannot naturally be brilliant
    - boolean (``true``, ``false``) -->

#### Notes
- Hooks function responsible for generating SymbolEncounts to write the proper hidden table to the encounter table parameter
    - In the vanilla game, each EncountSpawner is assigned a hash and the symbol encounter table is stored within the spawner object upon initialization
    - The hook needs to actively pull the proper encounter table based on player location every new symbol spawn (hidden encounts naturally do this)


### Live Randomizer ``[randomizer]``

Mod that live randomizes the species and form of all overworld spawns rather than statically randomizing the encounter tables they pull from

#### Example
https://github.com/Lincoln-LM/swsh-mods-exl/assets/73306575/c598db1b-d42d-4f3f-b5ff-db5652c9dfc0


#### Config
- ``active``
    - Controls whether or not the mod is activated
    - boolean (``true``, ``false``)

#### Notes
- Hooks the functions responsible for setting species & form for symbol, hidden, and gimmick encounters to overwrite the chosen species and form
    - A random species (randU64() % 898 + 1) and form (randU64() % form_count) are generated until one is found that exists in game

### Camera Tweaks ``[camera_tweaks]``

Mod that overwrites the default camera constants to allow tweaking of camera speed, pitch range, and field of view

Idea & recommendations by [norainthefuture](https://twitter.com/norainthefuture)

#### Example

    - Value is in degrees per time unit
    - float [``0.0``, ``360.0``)
- ``min_pitch``
    - Controls the minimum pitch of the camera
    - Value is in degrees
    - float [``-180.0``, ``180.0``)
- ``max_pitch``
    - Controls the maximum pitch of the camera
    - Value is in degrees
    - float [``-180.0``, ``180.0``)
- ``min_distance``
    - Controls the distance of the camera when zoomed in
    - float [``0.0``, ``...``)
- ``max_distance``
    - Controls the distance of the camera when zoomed out
    - float [``0.0``, ``...``)

#### Notes

### Level Cap Removal ``[uncap_level]``

Mod that removes the level cap-based shiny lock & (optionally) catch lock

#### Example

    - boolean (``true``, ``false``)
- ``fully``
    - Controls whether or not all level caps are removed
    - Must be set to true for level capped pokemon to be catchable
    - boolean (``true``, ``false``)

#### Notes
- Hooks the functions that set level cap based on badge count
    - if ``fully`` is set to ``true``: always return 100, otherwise: only return 100 when shiny locking

### Freecam ``[freecam]``

Mod that allows detaching the camera from the player and moving it on its own

#### Example
https://github.com/Lincoln-LM/swsh-mods-exl/assets/73306575/87cf634b-e205-48ff-88a2-a09ee89119e1

    - Controls whether or not the mod is activated
    - boolean (``true``, ``false``)
- ``maximum_spawns``
